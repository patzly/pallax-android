## Features

* Clean interface and highly customizable experience
* Support for Android 12 dynamic colors and color extraction
* System dependent dark mode with optionally switching between two wallpapers
* Power-efficient parallax effect on page swipe or when tilting the device
* Optional zoom effects on home screen and lockscreen
* Also suitable for large screens
* Many additional customization options
* Direct boot support (immediately active after device restart)
* No ads and no analytics
* Tiny installation size (~10MB)

## Compatibility

Pallax Android requires at least Android 5.0 Lollipop on your device. Because bitmap rendering is very slow without hardware acceleration, I strongly recommend at least Android 8 for a smooth experience because hardware acceleration for surfaces is not available on lower Android versions.
